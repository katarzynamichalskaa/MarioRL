# MarioRL
The MarioRL project is an exploration of reinforcement learning in the context of the popular game Mario. By employing reinforcement learning techniques, our goal is to create an agent that autonomously learns to play Mario, earn points, and effectively conquer levels. This exciting task requires an understanding of game mechanics, optimal decision-making, and refining strategies in a dynamic environment.
